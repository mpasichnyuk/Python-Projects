# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

# One line if statement:
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# One line if else statement:
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
# this technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions.

# One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

x = 41

# You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
